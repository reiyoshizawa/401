# Pre-requisite for this course.
- We are going to use **GCC compiler** and **VSCode** (or **Vim**) to write and compile our code.
- Check if you have **gcc** by, `$ gcc --version` in your terminal.
- If you don't have **gcc**, please go to [GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection](https://gcc.gnu.org) to install.
- If you have **homebrew**, run `$ brew install gcc`.

# Setting-up your environment with VSCode.
- Please watch the following video to setup your VSCode.
- This video demonstrates how to setup the environment for C++ but it is the same for C.
- They demo both for Mac and Windows.
- [VSCode: C/C++ Development with Visual Studio Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7CXjKGi_ro)
